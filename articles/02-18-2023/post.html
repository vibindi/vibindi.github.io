                    <p class="blog-post-meta">February 18, 2023</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        I should preface this article by telling you that I am a very loyal Philadelphia Eagles fan. Naturally, I am still recovering from this loss. But, we shouldn't let the Super Bowl loss distract us from what was otherwise a phenomenal season for the Eagles. Heading into the postseason, the Eagles had only lost 3 games: once in a home game against the Washington Commanders and twice (against the Cowboys and Saints) when an injured Jalen Hurts was replaced by the backup quarterback, Gardner Minshew. Eagles fans were spoiled with great performances this season.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One could just say that the Eagles were on the wrong side of a very well fought contest between two of the best teams in the NFL.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Still, as an Eagles fan eager to see my team lift up the Lombardi Trophy, I really wanted to see if there was anything we could have done differently that would have resulted in green confetti raining down in Arizona. Emotion-fueled rants about how Jonathan Gannon's (Defensive Coordinator) soft zone coverage led to a complete defensive breakdown should not be the only basis for analyzing our performance.
                        So, let's look at the stats.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>Offensive Performance</h5>

                    <p>
                        Other than a shocking Jalen Hurts fumble that led to a 36-yard Kansas City Chiefs scoop-and-score (fumble recovery touchdown) by Nick Bolton, the Philadelphia Eagles‚Äô offense executed at a pretty high level, especially for a 2nd year quarterback and head-coach duo.
                    </p>

                    <p>The Eagles ran the ball 33 times for a combined total of 117 yards and an average of 3.5 yards per run, split between 4 rushers.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Jalen Hurts: 72 yards</li>
                        <li>Kenneth Gainwell: 21 yards</li>
                        <li>Miles Sanders: 16 yards</li>
                        <li>Boston Scott: 8 yards</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img src="phi-rushing-split.png" alt="">
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Compared to a regular season average of rushing the ball 32 times for 147.6 yards and 4.6 yards per run per game, the Super Bowl run game seemed to be slightly less efficient. This could be explained be the Chiefs defensive line, led by Chris Jones, providing constant pressure and shutting down most of the big runs.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Eagles also took flight with Jalen Hurts throwing the ball 41 times for an impressive 302 passing yards and 7.4 yards per pass, split between 7 receivers.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>DeVonta Smith: 100 yards</li>
                        <li>AJ Brown: 96 yards</li>
                        <li>Dallas Goedert: 60 yards</li>
                        <li>Kenneth Gainwell: 20 yards</li>
                        <li>Zach Pascal: 11 yards</li>
                        <li>Boston Scott: 9 yards</li>
                        <li>Quez Watkins: 8 yards</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img src="phi-pass-split.png" alt="">
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Compared to a regular season average of throwing the ball 31.5 times for 256.7 yards and 8.1 yards per pass, the Eagles seemed to be much more reliant on the passing game. For the most part, it was pretty successful with quite a few 3rd and 4th down conversions and huge plays to DeVonta Smith and AJ Brown.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With only 3 offensive penalties: 1 false start, 1 offensive pass interference, and 1 delay of game (would have been 2, but a timeout was called prior to the play clock running out), the Eagles were relatively disciplined and had no huge, game-altering offensive penalties.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The offensive line also held strong. The only recorded sack in the game was when Jalen Hurts rolled out to the left and was pushed out of bounds for a 1 yard loss.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It looks like Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles offense kept them on the right track to win this game. So, was the problem with the defense?
                    </p>
                    <hr>

                    <h5>Defensive Performance</h5>
                    <p>For a defense that averaged 4.12 sacks and 1.59 turnovers a game in the regular season, having 0 of both in the Super Bowl is a defensive breakdown. Of course,
                        the Chiefs offensive line played incredibly well, but with the amount of talent on the Eagles defense, adjustments should have been made to create more pressure on Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.
                        In fact, much of the Chiefs' passing success can be attributed to Patrick Mahomes and the Eagles' inability to sack or tackle him.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the regular season, the Eagles defense allows 121.6 rushing yards and 180 passing yards. In the Super Bowl, they allowed 162 rushing yards and 182 passing yards. When Isaiah Pacheco and Patrick Mahomes ran the ball, the Eagles were not able to stop them. Additionally, a huge punt return by Kadarius Toney put the Chiefs in great field position to score a touchdown. Overall, their defense and special teams performance was not as great as its been all season. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The defense committed only 3 penalties: 1 illegal use of hands to the face, 1 neutral zone infraction, and 1 defensive holding. <strong>But</strong>, that defensive holding was completely game altering.
                        With less than a minute left, Mahomes threw an incomplete pass intended for JuJu Smith-Schuster (which sailed way past him) on a third down. This would have stopped the clock and provided much more time for the Eagles to put together
                        a game-winning touchdown or field goal drive. However, the referees called Eagles cornerback James Bradberry for a defensive holding. This was an extremely controversial call because even though there was contact, it was the same level of contact that the referees had accepted all game.
                        Additionally, the pass would not have been catchable for the receiver, even if the contact had not occurred.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This call, however, was not WHY the Eagles lost. Their defensive play was simply not good enough for the Super Bowl.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>Halftime Adjustments</h5>
                    <p>
                        Leading confidently 24-14 at halftime, the Eagles seemed to make minimal adjustments at halftime. The Chiefs, however, seemed to make many halftime adjustments both offensively and defensively, helping them outscore the Eagles 24-11 in the second half.
                        I believe this can be explained by the fact that the Chiefs are led by Head Coach Andy Reid, who has coached in 4 Super Bowls (1 with the Eagles and 3 with the Chiefs) and have plenty of experience with overcoming point deficits in big games. I think that this is a
                        good learning experience for Sirianni and how to manage the lead in big games.
                    </p>

                    <hr>

                    <p>
                        Regardless of this loss, the future of the Philadelphia Eagles looks incredibly bright. With a phenomenal 14-3 regular season record, in only the second year for Jalen Hurts as the starting quarterback, two first round picks in the upcoming draft, including a 10th overall pick, and a squad that should remain strong through this offseason, I firmly believe that the Eagles have the ability to return to the Super Bowl in the next few years and claim their second all-time Super Bowl trophy.
                    </p>
